# 🌐 [nohello.in](https://nohello.in) — End the Lonely "Hello"

> A friendly reminder: don't just say "Hello" in chat — say what you need.  
> Save time. Respect attention. Communicate better. ✨

## 👋 What is NoHello?

**NoHello** is a simple, open-source advocacy project promoting better chat etiquette.

Instead of typing just "Hello" (and making others wait), ask your question right away.  
We help people chat more effectively on platforms like Slack, Teams, Discord, and more.

## 🧠 Why it matters

Typing “Hello” and waiting is like calling someone, saying “Hi,” and putting them on hold.  
This habit wastes time and adds unnecessary friction in async communication.
