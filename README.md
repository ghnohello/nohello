# 👋 No Hello

A simple advocacy page promoting better chat etiquette — specifically, avoiding "just Hello" messages in online communication.

---

## 🚀 Mission

We're on a mission to end lonely "Hello?" messages and encourage clear, respectful, and productive online conversations. 

Typing "Hello" and waiting for a reply wastes time. Ask your question up front — be kind *and* efficient.
