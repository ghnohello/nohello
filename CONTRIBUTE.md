# 👋 Hey there, contributor!

Welcome to **nohello.in** – the tiniest website with the biggest cause: helping the world communicate better, one Slack message at a time.

We're glad you're here. This isn't just *our* project – it's *yours*, too.

---

## 🌱 What is this?

**nohello.in** is a tiny manifesto in website form. It encourages thoughtful communication and reminds people not to say just *"hello"* in chat. It’s a friendly nudge that’s helped thousands of people send better messages.

But the world is big, and languages are many.

That’s where **you** come in.

## 🌍 Ways You Can Contribute

This site is simple – your contribution doesn't need to be complex. Here's how you can help:

- 🌐 **Add a translation** – Help people *not* say “hello” in your language.
- ✍️ **Suggest better wording** – Polish the tone, improve clarity.
- 🧠 **Propose new ideas** – Add a new section, a fresh twist, or even a meme.
- 🐞 **Fix a typo** – Tiny fixes make big differences.
- 💅 **Tweak the design** – Keep it minimal, but keep it delightful.

## ⚠️ Important: Commit to `main` Only

> 🚨 We do **not** use pull requests or feature branches.  
> **All contributions must be committed directly to the `main` branch.**

Why? Because this site is simple by design. It’s static, it’s fast, and we want contributions to be too.

**If your PR is not based on `main`, it will be rejected.**  
Yes, even if it’s amazing. Yes, even if it’s a single comma fix.

So please:

```bash
git checkout main
````

Then work your magic.
